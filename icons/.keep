// This is a placeholder for the icon generation tool I should have used.
// Since I cannot actually generate a binary image file with 'write_to_file' easily without base64 or a tool, 
// I will rely on the user or a separate step to provide icons, 
// OR I will simply create dummy files to avoid errors if I had a tool for it.
// However, the manifest references icons/icon16.png etc.
// I will proceed without creating them for now, but I should probably mention it.
// Actually, I can use generate_image to create them!
